            <h2>How I Fell in Love with Basketball</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, basketball has been apart of my life. From shooting hoops in my backyard with my mom to playing with friends, and working out with my dad since I was young, the game has always been a source of connection and growth for me. Playing AAU was a huge turning point, giving me the opportunity to compete at a high level, gain exposure, and ultimately earn a scholarship to continue playing at the collegiate level. Through it all, having a strong support system has been essential in my journey, pushing me to strive even harder and fueling my love for the game.</p>
